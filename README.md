# Mediapipe-ROM
Mediapipe pose detection to measure the range of motion of a patient's shoulder joint.

# Installation
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the folder containing the repository in a command line and run `python -m venv .venv` to create a virutal environment (you may have to replace `python` with `python.exe` or `python3`).
4. Activate the venv. The command to do this is platform-specific so check [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work) to ensure you have the correct one.
5. With the venv activated run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libraries.
6. Run the script using `python mediapipe-rom.py` (again replace `python` if necessary).
